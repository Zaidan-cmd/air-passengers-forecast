# Section 1: Introduction

## 1.1 What is 'AirPassengers'

```         
```

```{r}
AirPassengers
```

As shown above 'AirPassengers' is a time series data set showing the
amount of airline passengers a month from 1949 to 1960.

## 1.2 The purpose of this project

This project will look into Meta Prophet predictions using the
'AirPassengers' time series dataset and seeing how true they are, and if
they are not giving reasons as to why it isn't.

## 1.3 Data preparation steps

1)  

```{r}
#install.packages("prophet")
```

Installs the prophet package from CRAN.

2)  

```{r}
library(prophet)
```

Loads the prophet package into the r session.

3)  

```{r}
#install.packages("remotes")
```

Installs the remotes package, which is used to load other packages not
in the CRAN.

4)  

```{r}
remotes::install_github('facebook/prophet@*release', subdir='R')
```

Installs the latest release of prophet from GitHub.

5)  

```{r}
data("AirPassengers")
```

Loads the AirPassengers data explained in section 1.1.

6)  

```{r}
start_date <- as.Date("1949-01-01")
```

Representing the start date of the time series.

7)  

```{r}
dates <- seq(start_date, by = "month", length.out = length(AirPassengers))
```

Generates a sequence of dates, atattching each data in the AirPassengers
data set to a month starting from 01/01/1949

8)  

```{r}
air.df <- data.frame(
    ds = dates,
    y = as.numeric(AirPassengers)
)
```

Makes a dataframe that will work with prophet, where 'ds' is the data
sequence and 'y' is the number of passengers.

9)  

```{r}
m <- prophet(air.df)
```

Fits the prophet model to air.df.

10) 

```{r}
future <- make_future_dataframe(m, periods = 100, freq = "month")
```

Creates a future dataframe for making predictions.

11) 

```{r}
forecast <- predict(m, future)
```

Uses the fitted model m to make predictions for the future.

12) 

```{r}
plot(m, forecast)
```

Plots the forecast.

## 1.4 Findings

![](images/Forecast%20Plot.png)

As shown in the image above, in 1950 the monthly number of aier
passengers was at roughly 1.25 million, an annual number of 15 million .
This rose to roughly 5 million a month in 1960, an annual number of 60
million.

The future is then forcasted, with an annual number of 100 million air
passengers by 1970. This however can be shown to be false.

![](images/Real%20Forecast.png)

As shown in the image above the actual number of global airline
passengers in 1970 was 382.95 million. This can be explained however.
The meta prophet forecast was based on the historical data, which did
not account for massive increases in airline technology and
globalisation advancements.

Some of these advancements include:

![](images/747.png)

The Boeing 747 was a huge leap in commercial air travel, it was a much
larger aircraft whilst also being more cost effective. This allowed
people to travel at a cheaper and more attractive price point.

![](images/Concorde.png)

The Concorde was also a another giant leap. it allowed travel to be much
quicker in turn making air travel even more attractive through how
efficient it was.

![](images/Other%20Advancements.png)

Deregulation also played a key role into the increase in air travel in
the 1970s. The Airline Deregulation Act allowed airlines to set their
own prices and routes, which caused increased competition and lower
prices.

Lastly there was also a big cultural shift when it came to air travel.
More people became excited by the idea of experiencing different
cultures and meeting different people.
